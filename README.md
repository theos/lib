# `theos/vendor/lib`
Libraries included with Theos for easy compilation of most projects out of the box.

This repo uses **.tbd** files, a plain text format that contains the minimum data needed for linking. These are supported as of clang 700 (Xcode 7) and are used in iOS 9.0 and newer SDKs. There is limited information available on them, but @inoahdev has made a .tbd generator called [tbd](https://github.com/inoahdev/tbd).
